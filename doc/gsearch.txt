gsearch is a Telescope-powered tool to allow you to use Google from neovim. You
can alternatively view this all in vim by running `:help gsearch`.

How to get gsearch in your neovim configuration.

REQUIREMENTS: ~


- Telescope <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim>
- macOS or Linux


INSTALLATION: ~

With vim-plug <https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug>

>
    Plug "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", { "tag": "0.1.0" }
    Plug "dzfrias/gsearch.nvim"
<


With packer.nvim <https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim>

>
    use {
      "dzfrias/gsearch.nvim",
      requires = { { "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", tag = "0.1.0" } },
    }
<


USAGE                                                          *gsearch-usage*

To use the lua api, run:

>
    require("gsearch").search()
<


There is also a vim command, `Gsearch`, so you can alternatively run `:Gsearch`
to achieve the same thing as the option above.

You can also pass in Telescope options to the `search` command.

Below are the default options for the setup function.

>
    require("gsearch").setup {
      -- Set to false to disable the plugin
      enabled = true,
      -- Whether to include what's in your Telescope prompt in the list of
      -- suggestions
      raw_included = true,
      -- The key to use to Google search for what's in your Telescope prompt
      -- without using one of the suggestions
      open_raw_key = "<s-CR>",
      -- The shell command to use to open the URL. As an empty string, it
      -- defaults to your OS defaults ("open" for macOS, "xdg-open" for Linux)
      open_cmd = "",
    }
<
